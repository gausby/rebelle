# Rebelle

A small tool that starts a repl session with a given list of modules loaded. Use this to play around with a given node module in a read-eval-print-loop.

Example:

```sh
$ rebelle --myModule lib/myModule.js
> myModule
[function]
>
```

This is essentially the same as opening a repl using `node` and writing `myModule = require('./lib/myModule')`â€”one could argue that this is a tad more convenient, though (some would perhaps argue the opposite, and very passionately).

An added benefit is that it will attempt to load the current node module if `rebelle` is executed within the folder structure of a node module. Also, if there is a `node_modules` folder in the current directory it will attempt to load them in and assign them to their package names.

Oh yeah, alpha software. Pull requests are welcome.


## Installation
Install it using `npm install rebelle -g`. A command line tool called `rebelle` should be available upon installation. Remove it again using `npm uninstall rebelle -g`.
